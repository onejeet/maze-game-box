# Advanced Maze Game Box
Accelerometer Controlled Advanced Maze Game Box basically is the collection of
different types of mazes games, which includes simple, complex and dynamic mazes,
a ball which is controlled by the tilt of the accelerometer and the time constraint
game play.
The main objective is to design a simplest and efficient approach in which the player
has to move ball through the maze to reach another end by using traditional way of
tilting to control the ball based on the classic find-your-way-in-maze puzzle and
Designing of Dynamic mazes.
This game box is implemented using 128x64 Graphic LCD as a display unit,
ATMega 32 as a controller and an Accelerometer as a sensor. A maze, a small shiny
ball and we used to apply our elemental understanding of gravity to bring the ball out
of the maze by integrating this most intriguing 'motion sensing' phenomenon in the
electronic framework.

## Features
